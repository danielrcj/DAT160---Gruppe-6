To run these robots, you first launch your world, then you launch the slam_robots.launch.py in a nother terminal. 

Sadly we did not manage to finish the task, so the robots will get a score of 0. This is becouse we had problems with the camera and the aucro markes.
So in the end we ran out of time to fix this. 
We were in route to get this finished by the deadline, but we found out last week that our teammate Daniel would not be allowed
to take his exam this year in this course. So in the end we were only two people working on this task.
